>About Me</center></h2>
<p class="text_p">In 1988, Paul Choi and Damee Choi established a local fashion business in Texas. With Paul’s intuition for business and Damee’s passion for fashion, they began their business of women’s clothing. 
With success over the years, they decided to move to New York to pursue greater success.In 1994, they debuted as Design 36 in the center of Garment District of New York. With much competition surrounding them, they welcomed the challenge and the opportunity to make the best selection of styles. 
In 2010, Design 36 became known as ‘Damee New York,’ offering women’s clothing while valuing individuality, confidence, beauty and quality.Now in 2013, Damee New York has broadened its market to over 45 states in the United States and Canada. With the support of our sales representatives and office administrators, we try our best to sustain the relationship with our valued retailers. We have grown to have more than 2,000 valued customers and continue to grow every day.
